        <p>
 Ameda Temple, located on the banks of Vembanad Lake in Kerala, is a unique temple
 dedicated to Sapthamathrukkal, the seven mother goddesses, along with deities like 
 Ganapathy, Veerabhadran, and Vishnu. The temple's significance lies in its devotion 
 to snakes, with shrines for Nagaraja (snake god) and Nagayakshi located within the 
 complex. Unique rituals, including Sarpabali and Ashtanagapooja, are performed to 
 appease the snakes and gain their blessings, further contributing to the temple's 
 mystical atmosphere.
